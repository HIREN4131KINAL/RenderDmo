A print adapter interacts with the Android print \n framework and handles the steps of the printing process. \n This process requires users to select printers and print options before creating a document for printing. These selections can influence the final output as the user chooses printers with different output capabilities, different page sizes, or different page orientations. As these selections are made, the print framework asks your adapter to lay out and generate a print document, in preparation for final output. Once a user taps the print button, the framework takes the final print document and passes it to a print provider for output. During the printing process, users can choose to cancel the print action, so your print adapter must also listen for and react to a cancellation requests.A print adapter interacts with the Android print framework and handles the steps of the printing process.
